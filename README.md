How to run on Windows:

1) Install the most recent version of ursina with "pip install."
If you are using VS code try installing ursina as native through "pip install ursian" in your Python Environment tab under Packages(PyPI), you're less likely to have bugs.
2) Clone or download the game's repo with "git clone" or extract the zip file and double click Mad Island.

3) Move into the game's directory and run main.py with "main.py."


If you get stuck inside geometry, or fall through the world:
Press Ctrl+R to reset the player position. I also have a second floor under the world to catch you.
